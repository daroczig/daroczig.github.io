# A Decade of Using R in Production

R is often not taken seriously by Real Programmers, and considered a scripting language for ad-hoc data analysis, which is a great interactive tool used by data scientists, but the models (obviously written in notebooks) will eventually need to be productionized using a Real Programming Language. I am also biased, and tend to be similarly opinionated about R (although in the opposite direction), but instead of arguing that R is now ready for production, this talk will just rather share some use-cases and best practices on how I managed to use R in production from small to large companies for ETL, reporting, modeling, live-scoring, stream processing and many more.
